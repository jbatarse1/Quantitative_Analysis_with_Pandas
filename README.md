# Quantitative_Analysis_with_Pandas
Use Metrics to analyze Risk & Return and Diversify Portfolio

This program is to develop a **Python** application within Jupyter Lab and to perform quantitative analysis for the evaluation of the funds portfolios.

To determine which fund portfolio has the better risk & reward profile, metrics calculated are daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe Ratio, and beta. The S&P 500 is used as a benchmarket to compare funds performances.Plots are also created to visualize the information for better decision making.

The results from this analysis will indicate the best choice of fund to add to sa porfolio for diversification.

## Usage

To run this application, create a clone on the local desktop. Then, within the folder where program is located, open file 'risk_reward_analysis.ipynb'. The Resources folder has the reference file 'whale_nav.csv'. 

Steps for running application:

1st. Import Data: path the 'whale_nav.csv' file into the program and prepared data.

2nd. Quantitative Analysis: analyze performance, volatility, risk and risk-return profiles.

3rd. Diversify Porfolio: evaluate how the porfolios react relative to the market.
