# Quantitative_Analysis_with_Pandas
Use Metrics to analyze Risk & Return and Diversify Portfolio

This program is to develop a **Python** application within Jupyter Lab and to perform quantitative analysis for the evaluation of the funds portfolios.

To determine which fund portfolio has the better risk & reward profile, metrics calculated are daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe Ratio, and beta. The S&P 500 is used as a benchmarket to compare funds performances.Plots are also created to visualize the information for better decision making.

The results from this analysis will indicate the best choice of fund to add to sa porfolio for diversification.
